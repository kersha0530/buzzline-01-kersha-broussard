# Buzzline Project 

## buzzline-01-kersha-broussard

This project implements a producer-consumer model for real-time logging and message processing.

## Custom Scripts

### Custom Producer: `new_producer_script.py`
This custom producer generates dynamic log messages every few seconds, simulating real-time data production. Messages are written to a log file.

#### Usage
To run the custom producer:
```bash``
# Navigate to the producers directory
cd producers

# Run the producer script
C:\Users\kbrou\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe new_producer_script.py

#### Custom Consumer: `kersha_new_basic_consumer_script.py`
This custom consumer continuously monitors the producer's log file, reads log messages in real-time, and processes them. Alerts are generated for specific patterns.

## Usage
To run the custom consumer:

# Navigate to the consumers directory
cd consumers

# Run the consumer script
C:\Users\kbrou\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe kersha_new_basic_consumer_script.py

## Logs Directory
All logs are stored in the logs directory:

#### Producer Logs:

producer_log.log: Logs generated by the producer script.

#### Consumer Logs:

consumer_log_kersha.log: Logs from the custom consumer.
